### Copyright
This project is read only. That is why there is no license provided with it. I would like people to see this work and learn from it, however. Since the data this scrapes from comes from j-archive, which hosts data that is not legally theirs, I do not want to cause any trouble for the j-archive team that is really doing god's work. So please, be mindful of how you use this repository.


Enjoy!
